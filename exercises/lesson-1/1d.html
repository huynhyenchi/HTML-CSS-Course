<p>Hello, universe!</p>
<p>Today i learned about basic steps of creating a website, I am learning about html and css which are the first steps of becoming a coder.</p>
<p>Hope that it could help me make money, I will learn to become a coder by all my constancy because I have a big dream about having a independent life, I dream about freedom, a appropriate environment at another city like Da Nang</p>
<p>Sinerely,</p>
